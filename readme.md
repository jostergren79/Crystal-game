## How to Play

2. Below the target score, you'll see four crystals. Each crystal has a random hidden value.
3. Click on a crystal to reveal its value and add it to your total score.
4. Try to match your total score to the target score without going over.
5. If your total score matches the target score, you win. If your score goes over, you lose.
